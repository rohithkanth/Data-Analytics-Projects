## About

Hi, I'm Rohith Kanth Dumpeti! I'm a recent graduate of VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology from Information Technology Branch(2019-2023), 
In my 4 years of Bachelor's I got a keen Intrest on SQL and Python, being a person with Analytical mindset and detail oriented I got my intrest on data analysis.  I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
